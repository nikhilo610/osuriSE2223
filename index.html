              adults is a natural behavior. This engineering project was aimed at solving the issue of children sustaining 
              head injuries by falling over in a chair. The engineering goal for this project is to design, build, and test 
              a stopper that can be attached to the ends of a chair's legs that will prevent it from tipping over. A CAD 
              model of the prototype was initially designed in Autodesk Fusion 360, but was later recreated using wood and 
              screws. Tests were run using a force sensor that measured how much force it took to tip a chair with and without
              the apparatus attached. Data was collected using the Vernier Logger Lite Software and data analysis was done 
              entirely in Google Sheets. After the four T-Tests were completed, the results of those tests suggested that 
              there was a significant difference between the 0, 50, and 100 pound trials while the 150 pound trial had no 
              significant difference between the force reading trials for the 150 pound loaded chair with the apparatus and
              the 150 pound loaded chair without the apparatus. This engineering project can help to inspire others to 
              develop unique solutions for similar problems in the future.

            <h1 id="ovPadRight">Rationale</h1>
            <p class="lead overview-font overview-text" id="ovPadRight"> 57 million children in the US are currently enrolled in school, and 
              the number of children who suffer head injuries in the classroom is steadily on the rise (Bustamante). While a 
              number of these injuries are sports-related, a large majority of these injuries are accidental, such as falling 
              backward in a chair. It may seem obvious that rocking in a chair is dangerous because the chair can fall over, 
              which can lead to traumatic head injuries. However, it isn't as easy as telling children to stop rocking their 
              chairs back and forth. Factors such as whether or not a child can focus, classroom seating, and overall off-task 
              behavior in a classroom all contribute to the number of chair-falling head injuries. Children who cannot focus in 
              class often engage in off-task behaviors such as rocking their chairs back and forth, which can then lead to 
              further injuries (Parcells). A stopper that can be used on the legs of chairs in classrooms can help solve this 
              problem of children tilting backward in their chairs and sustaining head injuries.
